        text: `Slobodan Milošević was a leader in Yugoslavia and later Serbia. He was born in 1941. In the late 1980s, he became the President of Serbia. At that time, Yugoslavia was a country made of different groups. Milošević was a nationalist. He wanted strong power for the Serbian people. His speeches made people from other groups angry and afraid. In the 1990s, Yugoslavia began to break apart into smaller countries. This led to wars in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo. Milošević supported Serbian armies in these wars. The fighting was very brutal. Many terrible crimes were committed. People were forced out of their homes because of their ethnicity. This is called ethnic cleansing. Milošević was blamed for causing these wars and suffering. The wars destroyed the economy and isolated Serbia. In 2000, huge protests forced him to leave office. He was arrested and sent to an international court in The Hague. He was charged with war crimes and genocide. He died in his prison cell in 2006 before his trial was finished.`,

There was a failed coup, and Suharto took control of the army. He led a violent crackdown against Communists. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed during this time. In 1967, he became the President. He called his government the "New Order." Suharto focused on building the economy. Under his rule, Indonesia became more modern and stable. Many people got better jobs. However, Suharto was a dictator. He did not allow real democracy. He controlled the elections so he would always win. His family and friends controlled the biggest businesses. They became incredibly rich through corruption. This is called "crony capitalism." He ruled for more than 30 years. In 1998, there was a big financial crisis in Asia. The Indonesian economy crashed. Students and workers protested in the streets. Suharto lost the support of the people and the army.
